# ngQuotogenic

## Quotogenic built with Angular.js (in progress)

This project is based on re-designing www.quotogenic.com using the Angular.js framework.  
Abstracting all backend functionality into a REST API, and using Angular's two way data binding
to allow for easier real-time updates in a Single-Page-Application powered quote/photo matching platform.

## Where to begin

### app directory

The application is built off angular-seed, a boilerplate for angular/bower enabled applications.
You'll find the actual code residing in the "app" directory
